## Responsabilities
Community handlers are entrusted with defining, upholding, and consistently applying the standards of conduct outlined in this document. When behavior arises that is inappropriate, harmful, intimidating, or otherwise inconsistent with these expectations, handlers will take quicl, fair, and appropriate action to address the situation.

Community handlers also reserve the authority to moderate community spaces as needed. This may include editing, removing, or declining comments, contributions, commits, code, documentation, issues, or other content that does not adhere to this Code of Conduct. When suitable, they will provide clear explanations for moderation actions to maintain transparency and trust.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and whenever a contributor is representing the community in public. This includes using official accounts, communication channels, or speaking on behalf of the project. Handlers may also clarify what counts as representation if needed.

## Enforcement Procedure
Community handlers will respond to concerns in a manner that is thoughtful, consistent, and proportionate to the nature and impact of the behavior. Our approach prioritizes education, accountability, and the safety of the community. When necessary, restrictions on participation may be applied to prevent harm and maintain a respectful environment.

Possible enforcement actions include:
