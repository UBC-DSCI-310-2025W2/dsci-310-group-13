## Project Summary

Our goal of the project is to classify the quality of the wine as a number between 0 and 10 depending on chemical properties such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar,chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH and sulphates.

We will be using the Wine Quality dataset on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. There are 13 variables and 4898 records. There are no missing values. 

## how to run the data analysis
Using supervised machine learning classification models, we analyze how chemical characteristics influence perceived wine quality and evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics.

The analysis follows these steps:

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Model training (classification algorithms)
4. Model evaluation and comparison
5. Results visualization
